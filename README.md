# Lion Dance Run!

## Foreword?

Ok so I know that I ask a lot out of you guys when I talk about making this
game, but not many of you have nearly as much experience as I have.
I've tried to make everything more convenient by commenting before as many
blocks of code as I can.

Comments begin with a double slash (i.e. //) and have plain text in them.
Whatever text you put in there doesn't get run by the computer, even if its
actual code, so it's pretty convenient. In fact, this whole block is a huge
comment oAo

You guys don't have to be experts to contribute, I don't want to be the
busybody running the whole project by myself without leaving room for
teamwork, so please come to me if you need any kind of help whatsoever.


Here is a list of resources so everybody can all get in together on developing
this game :)
